üéµ HIT SONG PREDICTION PROJECT - FINAL REPORT
===================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
------------------
This project successfully developed a machine learning system that predicts 
hit songs with 79.8% accuracy using audio features extracted from song choruses. 
The system analyzes 14 core audio characteristics and 52 engineered features 
to determine a song's potential for commercial success.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
‚Ä¢ Accuracy: 79.8% with SVM model
‚Ä¢ Dataset: 41,106 songs across 6 decades (1960s-2010s)
‚Ä¢ Features: 66 engineered audio characteristics
‚Ä¢ Best Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

BUSINESS IMPACT:
Record labels and artists can use this system to:
‚Ä¢ Identify potential hit songs early in production
‚Ä¢ Optimize song arrangements for maximum appeal
‚Ä¢ Understand what audio features drive popularity
‚Ä¢ Make data-driven decisions in music production

TECHNICAL INNOVATION:
‚Ä¢ Novel feature engineering focusing on instrumentalness ratios
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive decade-wise analysis
‚Ä¢ Ensemble of 6 different ML algorithms
‚Ä¢ Robust preprocessing pipeline

CONCLUSION:
The project demonstrates that machine learning can effectively predict 
song popularity based on audio features, providing valuable insights 
for the music industry.
