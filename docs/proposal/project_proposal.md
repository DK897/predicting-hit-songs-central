# Hit Song Prediction - Project Proposal

## Problem Statement
Can we predict whether a song will be a hit based solely on its audio features extracted from the chorus?

## Objectives
1. Combine decade-based song datasets (1960s-2010s)
2. Extract and engineer audio features
3. Train multiple machine learning models
4. Evaluate model performance
5. Identify key features that contribute to song popularity

## Methodology
- Data: Billboard chart data + audio features
- Features: Danceability, energy, valence, tempo, etc.
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## Expected Outcomes
- A model that can predict hit songs with >65% accuracy
- Insights into what audio features make songs popular
- Comprehensive analysis report
