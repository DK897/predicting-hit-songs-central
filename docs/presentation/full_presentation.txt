PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Predicting hit songs using audio features with 79.8% accuracy

==================================================

SLIDE: Problem Statement & Motivation
------------------------------

PROBLEM:
Can we predict hit songs based solely on audio features?

MOTIVATION:
- Music industry invests billions in song production
- Traditional A&R is subjective and risky
- Data-driven approach can reduce uncertainty
- Understand what makes songs popular

==================================================

SLIDE: Dataset & Methodology
------------------------------

DATASET:
- 41,106 songs from 1960s-2010s
- Billboard charts + audio features
- Balanced: 50% hits, 50% non-hits

METHODOLOGY:
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering (66 features)
3. Model Training (6 algorithms)
4. Evaluation & Visualization

==================================================

SLIDE: Feature Engineering
------------------------------

FEATURES CREATED:

BASE FEATURES (14):
- danceability, energy, valence, tempo
- acousticness, instrumentalness, loudness
- speechiness, liveness, duration, etc.

ENGINEERED FEATURES (52):
- Feature interactions and ratios
- Temporal characteristics  
- Decade encodings
- Composite features

==================================================

SLIDE: Model Performance
------------------------------

ACCURACY RESULTS:

🏆 SVM: 79.8% ✅
Logistic Regression: 75.7%
Neural Network: 69.8%
Random Forest: 62.1%
